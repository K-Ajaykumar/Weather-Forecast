## Configuration
You must receive an API key in order to use the OpenWeatherMap API. The steps to setup your API key are as follows:

* Visit https://openweathermap.org to access the OpenWeatherMap website.
* Create a free account, or sign in with an existing one. * After logging in, select the "API Keys" area from your profile.
* Create a fresh API key and duplicate it. Find the script.js file within the project directory. There is a constant in this file named API_KEY. You can get your real API key from OpenWeatherMap by replacing the placeholder value 'YOUR_API_KEY' with it.
```
const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
```
